# Bonus Shipbash
My first custom Game Maker content, originally a bonus level to the academic program, Super Rainbow Reef.

## Premise
The due date for Super Rainbow Reef was quite far away, so I decided to add an extra complex bonus level. I just kept adding to it, to the point where it became its own standalone game.

## Usage
Game requirements are the same as Game Maker 8.1's requirements. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the critter to bounce the ship around. Goal is to let the critter escape via a hole in the wall.
